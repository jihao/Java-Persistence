Java-Persistence
================

My practice code during learning ["Enterprise JavaBeans 3.0"](http://www.oreilly.com.cn/index.php?func=book&isbn=978-7-121-04001-6), this is a nice book.

* Chapter 5 Persistence: EntityManager

* Chapter 6 Mapping Persistent Objects

## Why?

* type & practise the code from the book
* use maven to manage the dependence 
* it will be nice for quickly remember JPA stuff with a handy runable small app


## History
* I was learning JPA 4 year ago, and the code was orignally stored at googlecode (http://code.google.com/p/ejb3study/source/list), the old project was not maven based.
